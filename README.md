#TheU


THE U  is  a simple message board application that allows users to post on a topic of their choosing. The original thought included the ability to log in and comment with a proprietary system but i was unable to complete that portion of the project.

## getting started

the landing page shows any post that has already been created.
clicking on any image or tag line will take you to the show page where you can edit the post. Also you can like or comment on it through facebook if you have an account.

## unresolved issues

As I stated above i wasn't able to complete the user portion of the site.
